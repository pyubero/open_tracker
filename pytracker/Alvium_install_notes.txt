Step 1.
Go to Allied Vision Download center to download the SDK.
In our case we installed v5.1.0 for Windows from:
	https://www.alliedvision.com/en/support/software-downloads/

Install on: C:\Program Files\Allied Vision\Vimba_5.1
and examples in : C:\Users\Public\Documents\Allied Vision\Vimba_5.1

And BE SURE to install the Python Api, although we recommend a complete installation of the SDK.


Step 2.
Go the C:\Program Files\Allied Vision\Vimba_5.1\VimbaPython\Documentation
and follow the manual's instructions for installing the python package.

Basically they say to execute from a (conda) terminal in the sources folder the following command: python -m pip install .[numpy-export,opencv-export]
